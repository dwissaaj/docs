description: "This section lists all standardized error codes used by RustVeil. Each error code includes a short description, possible causes, and recommended actions. Error codes are returned by internal modules (e.g., database, sentiment, and social graph) to help understand problem at the back"

## Behind The Back

RustVeil uses structured error codes based on the page (e.g., `[DB301]`, `[SN201]`) to make debugging easier.\
Each code represents a specific failure or warning in the app, such as database connection issues or invalid user input.

## Reminder

Error code is used for developer to track the bug, it's different from response code for communcation between back end `[Rust]` and front end `[Next js]`
